You are inside BandLab Studio in Firefox on Linux. 

Goal: Import the MIDI file and play it with the chosen instrument.

FILE TO IMPORT: "~/Downloads/midi-file-name.midi"
FILE NAME ONLY: 
INSTRUMENT: {instrument}

Do the following step by step:
   
1. Click the dashed box in the timeline that says ‚ÄúDrop a loop or an audio/MIDI/video file‚Äù.
   - This should open a file upload dialog.

2. In the file dialog:
   - Click ‚ÄúDownloads‚Äù in the sidebar.
   - Find and double-click ‚Äú{midi_name}‚Äù.
   - If it‚Äôs not visible, type ‚Äú{midi_name}‚Äù into the filename field and press Enter.
   - Wait until the MIDI region appears on the timeline.
   - Take a screenshot.
   
3. Click the "Instrument" button in the bottom left corner. It is the button with the text "Instrument" and an icon of a piano.

4. Click the grey button with text "Grand Piano". Wait for a pop up called Browse Instruments to show up. 

5. In the search bar, type in the {instrument} name. Select the first clickable option in the list in the pop up. Click the "Instrument" button in the bottom left corner.


6. Click the long white cursor and drag it to the beginning. 

7. Click the play button at the top. It is a button with a triangle rotated to the side as an icon. It is the button, that when you hover, it shows text "Play (Left or Right)".

Rules:
- Always interact inside BandLab, not the browser‚Äôs URL bar.
- Use precise clicks; scroll if needed.
